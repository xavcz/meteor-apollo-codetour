Hopefully, you now have a **better understanding of what "using Apollo in a Meteor app" means under the hood**.

After all, it's _not that_ terrible! üåÆ

<a href="https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/blob/master/README.md#3-5"><h2>Add the package!</h2></a>

If you want to use this package in your Meteor app:
```sh
# install the node dependencies
npm install --save apollo-client graphql-server-express express graphql graphql-tools body-parser
# install the meteor package
meteor add apollo
```

<a href="https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/blob/master/README.md#6-8"><h2>Get started in your app</h2></a>

That's great to know how it works... but the end goal is to use Apollo & Meteor together, isn't it? üòè

To get started, here are some useful resources:

- [The official Meteor - Apollo docs](http://dev.apollodata.com/core/meteor.html): it should look familiar to you now, and it provides practical examples on giving a schema to `createApolloServer` or setting up Apollo Client with `meteorClientConfig`.

- [Meteor - Apollo Starter Kit](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-starter-kit/): a simple kit to start experimenting with Apollo, Meteor and React.
